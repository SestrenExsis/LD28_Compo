A shark ate your other oar: A game made in one hour

This was my competition entry for the 28th Ludum Dare game jam.

You've only got one oar to make it to the dock!
I've only got one hour (technically one and a half hours) to make a game!

Story
A shark ate your other oar!
You'll have to paddle to the dock with your only remaining oar. Without two oars, most of your momentum will go into spinning your boat, so you have to switch which side the oar is on in order to keep moving forward.
Avoid the shark and make it to safety!

Controls
Use the arrow keys to control your boat:
Left Arrow: Puts your oar on the left side of your boat.
Right Arrow: Puts your oar on the right side of your boat.
Up Arrow: Paddle forward.
Down Arrow: Paddle backward.
